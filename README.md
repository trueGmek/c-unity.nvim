# C-Unity.nvim

**Disclaimer:** This project is currently under development. Features may be incomplete or subject to change. This README file was generated by an LLM.

Tired of switching between Unity and Neovim? This plugin aims to streamline your C# development workflow in Unity by bringing Unity logs and compilation commands directly into Neovim.

## Features

-   **Automatic Connection:** Automatically connects to the Unity Editor when a Unity project is detected.
-   **View Unity Logs:** View logs from Unity in a floating window inside Neovim.
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Custom syntax highlighting for Unity logs, with support for warnings and errors.
-   **Recompile Command:** Send a recompile command to Unity directly from Neovim.
-   **Customizable Window:** The log window can be customized (border, size, etc.).
-   **Debug Mode:** Enable debug notifications for troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires the accompanying plugin (*TBD*) to be running in your Unity project.

## Installation

You can install this plugin using your favorite plugin manager.

### Packer

```lua
use {
    "gmek/c-unity.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("c-unity").setup()
    end
}
```

## Configuration

The `setup` function can be called with a configuration table to override the default settings.

```lua
require("c-unity").setup({
    debug = false, -- Enable debug notifications
    loop = { -- Connection loop settings
        timeout = 1000,
        repeat_time = 1000,
        limit = 100
    },
    connection = { -- Pipe names
        server_read_pipe_name = "/tmp/unity-pipe-read",
        server_write_pipe_name = "/tmp/unity-pipe-write"
    },
    window = { -- Log window settings
        filetype = "cunitylog",
        border = "rounded",
        style = "minimal",
        relative = "editor",
        width_perct = 0.8,
        height_perct = 0.8,
    }
})
```

## Usage

The plugin automatically detects a Unity project by looking for `Assets` and `ProjectSettings` directories. Once a project is detected, it will attempt to connect to the Unity Editor.
